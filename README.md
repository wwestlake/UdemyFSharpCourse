# UdemyFSharpCourse
This course covers the basics of F# and Functional Programming techniques 
with real world applications involving validating user input in a functional methodology.  
The course covers a number of supporting topics such as immutable data, designing 
with types, using types to contain data and handle errors.  In this course you will 
use the F# interactive to test code that we are designing, then use the code in a 
simple console application to ensure that all parts work together, and finally 
connect the code to a real web application to validate user input.  By the end of 
the course you will have a partially working web application that you can use to 
practice your skills by extending and expanding upon the examples we develop together.
